Python constraint programming library
=====================================

OCaml Facile library is an excellent tool for solving constraint programming problems in OCaml. Facile stands for "Functional Constraint Library". Besides, "facile" means "easy" in French!

This code is a Cython-based wrapping in Python of basic functionalities of this library.

The documentation (installation, quickstart and examples) has been moved to [readthedocs.org](http://facile.readthedocs.io/).

#### Things left to do

- Find a way to better parametrize the resolution process (heuristics, variable choice order, etc.)
- Study the feasibility of building your own constraints in pure Python.
